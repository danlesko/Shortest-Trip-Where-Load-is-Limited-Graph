# Shortest-Trip-Where-Load-is-Limited-Graph

The point of the project was to determine the least number of trips between any two destinations on a graph. The idea was that we needed to get a group of tourists from point A to point B on a bus where the roads the bus traveled on could only carry a limited number of people between each city. I created a depth first seach that starts at a given point and finds the path that takes the largest number of tourists between the adjacent points all the way to the end point.
